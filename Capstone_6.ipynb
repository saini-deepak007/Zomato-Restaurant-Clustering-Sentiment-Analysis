        "The restaurant industry in India has been growing rapidly, with platforms like Zomato playing a key role in connecting customers with restaurants. With thousands of restaurants across different cities, cuisines, and cost categories, customers often face difficulty in choosing the best restaurant that fits their needs. At the same time, Zomato as a company needs to understand customer preferences, identify areas of improvement, and make business decisions based on data. This project aims to solve these challenges using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering), and Sentiment Analysis on Zomato’s restaurant and review datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step of the project was data understanding and cleaning. Two main datasets were used: one containing restaurant information (name, location, cuisines, cost for two, ratings, and votes) and another containing customer reviews. Initial data exploration revealed missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats in both datasets. These were handled using standard preprocessing techniques like imputation, removal of unnecessary columns, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical ones. In the review data, text preprocessing was carried out by removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying lemmatization to prepare for sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed. The EDA highlighted important patterns such as the distribution of restaurants across major cities, the most popular cuisines, variations in average cost for two people, and the spread of ratings and votes. Visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn made it easier to uncover insights at a glance. For instance, some cities had a high concentration of fine-dining restaurants, while others leaned toward affordable local eateries. This phase provided the foundation for deeper analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next part of the project focused on Unsupervised Machine Learning through clustering. Since the dataset did not contain predefined restaurant categories, clustering techniques were ideal for segmenting restaurants into meaningful groups. After scaling the features, the Elbow Method was applied to determine the optimal number of clusters. Two algorithms were implemented for comparison: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The clusters revealed natural groupings such as budget-friendly restaurants, mid-range casual dining, premium fine-dining options, and high-cost but low-rated outliers. These clusters provided actionable insights for both customers and Zomato.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to clustering, the project applied Sentiment Analysis to the review dataset. Using techniques like VADER/TextBlob, reviews were classified into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments. This analysis helped identify how customers perceived different clusters of restaurants. For example, budget clusters tended to have mixed sentiments, while premium clusters attracted more positive reviews but also higher expectations and criticisms. Furthermore, reviewer metadata allowed identification of frequent critics and influential reviewers, which can be valuable for Zomato in reputation management.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combined results of clustering and sentiment analysis led to several business insights. For customers, the project helps in identifying the best value-for-money restaurants in their locality, discovering popular cuisines, and choosing places with consistently positive reviews. For Zomato, the clustering provides a clear segmentation of restaurants to guide marketing campaigns, targeted promotions, and resource allocation. Sentiment analysis highlights areas where customer satisfaction is low, helping Zomato work with restaurant partners to improve service quality and food standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of combining EDA, clustering, and sentiment analysis to extract actionable insights from raw restaurant and review data. For Zomato, these insights can directly support business growth, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage in the food delivery industry. For customers, the analysis makes restaurant discovery simpler and more personalized. The project also highlights the scalability of unsupervised learning and natural language processing in real-world business applications. With further enhancements, such as integrating real-time reviews and adding recommendation systems, this project could evolve into a robust decision-support tool for both Zomato and its users."
